        <h2>About Kolkata</h3>
        <article>Kolkata is the capital of India’s West Bengal state. It is also one of the largest cities in India and the country’s main port for trade with Asia.
            he city of Kolkata is a cultural center for the whole country. There are more than 30 museums in the city and nearby towns. In addition, Kolkata hosts many music, theater, and dance performances. Artists, writers, musicians, and filmmakers have made Kolkata home for years. 
            
            Kolkata is known for processing jute, a locally grown plant that is used to make heavy woven cloth. Other manufacturers in the city produce textiles, chemicals, and computer products. Most of the economy, however, is based on services and trade. Several bridges lead out of the city across the Hugli River. The main bridge is called the Rabindra Setu. </article>
