        <h2>About Kerela</h3>
        <article>Kerala state is located in the southwest corner of India. It is surrounded by the Arabian sea from the south and west, the north is Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu is to the East. The capital of Kerala is Thiruvananthapuram.
            Flanked by the Arabian Sea in the West, the towering Western Ghats in the East and networked by 44 interconnected rivers, Kerala is blessed with a unique set of geographical features that have made it one of the most sought after tourist destinations in Asia. 
            Kerala prides itself for being the flag bearer for not just how a culture can respect its past but also march forward with growth & progress as well. Hundred percent literacy, world-class health care systems, India's lowest infant mortality and highest life expectancy rates are among a few of the milestones that the people of the state are extremely proud of.</article>
